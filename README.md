## 📌 Overview  
Most people move through their day without realizing how daily activity patterns affect their health. Step counters and basic fitness apps provide numbers, but they don’t explain what those numbers mean for the **heart, lungs, and joints**.  

**Actify** goes beyond simple tracking. It transforms raw motion sensor data into **meaningful health insights**, showing users how close they are to achieving an optimal daily balance. The app provides a **percentage wellness score** and personalized guidance to help improve overall well-being through small, actionable changes.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Home Page Hub** – Centralized access to all features.  
- **AI Activity Tracker** – Detects and records movements like walking, sitting, standing, climbing, or lying down. Logs are stored in statistics and activity history.  
- **Health Metrics Dashboard** – Translates activity ratios into effects on cardiovascular, respiratory, and joint health.  
- **Wellness AI Chatbot** – A personal health companion that explains activity data, provides tips, and answers wellness questions.
